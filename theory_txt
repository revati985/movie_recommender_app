TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It’s a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
to convert text into numerical values (vectorization)— especially useful for machine learning models, including content-based recommenders.

🔍 What does it do?
TF-IDF helps measure how important a word is in a document compared to all the other documents in a collection (like all movie overviews).

💡 TF-IDF = TF × IDF
TF (Term Frequency) – How often a word appears in a single document (e.g., one movie's description).

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) – How unique or rare that word is across all documents.

✅ Why use it in a Movie Recommender?
In your app: You extract text features (like movie overviews, tags, etc.).

TF-IDF helps find similar movies by comparing the importance of keywords in each movie's description.

Then you use cosine similarity to measure how close two movie vectors are — and recommend similar ones.

🔧 Example:
If the word “love” appears in almost every movie overview, its importance is low (IDF is low).
But if “cyberpunk” appears only in a few, it gets a higher weight — great for genre-specific recommendations.

Pycharm deployment 
(Open cmd through project folder, run )
-> Python -m venv venv  
This creates virtual env (easy to deploy)

Open project folder in pycharm!
